<h3>Technological Excellence</h3>
<p>Proven across many human experiments to measurably increase your tranquility levels, to provide better structure for your mental balance metrics, and to stabilize values across your mood reports.</p>
<p>The Zentronix uses recently-developed algorithms to create the most soothing environments on the intermarket. The floral and vegetal models are based on ancient life forms, the sight of which has been scientifically proven to reconnect us to our more fundamental natures.</p>
<p>The subtle textures and multi-spectrum color tones of the visual stimulus are specially designed and digitally evolved to create the most immersive possible experience. The creatures populating the virtual space exist on no known planet, but are clever amalgamations of common creature-forms</p>
