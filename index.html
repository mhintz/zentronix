<h3>Technological Excellence</h3>
<p>Proven across many human experiments to measurably increase your tranquility levels, to provide better structure for your mental balance metrics, and to stabilize values across your mood reports.</p>
<p>The Zentronix uses recently-developed algorithms to create the most soothing environments on the intermarket. The floral and vegetal models are based on ancient life forms, the sight of which has been scientifically proven to reconnect us to our more fundamental natures.</p>
<p>The subtle textures and multi-spectrum color tones of the visual stimulus are specially designed and digitally evolved to create the most immersive possible experience. The creatures populating the virtual space exist on no known planet, but are clever amalgamations of common creature-forms</p>

"The Zentronix machine almost completely blocks out the noise. It's such a soothing relief to return to it each evening after a long day of net-work and watch the lightglobe set over distant hills. I'm almost overwhelmed with feelings as I slip into the comfort of my gel chair and strap on the sensory-replacement mechanism."

<h3>Unparalleled User Experiences</h3>
<p>~~Cathy P1519~~</p>
<p>
Cathy P1519 was a nervous wreck, the griding of her teeth lost beneath the grinding of her storage sector. Every cycle, she woke to a new cramp or pain, her net contacts suffered, and her productivity was showing dramatic early indicators of decline. A google consult recommended that she try out improving her reality+ module, so she ordered a new Zentronix.
</p>
<p>
Within weeks of beginning to use the new Zentronix for cognitive and emotional load reduction, she began to feel substantially more at peace. "To enter the space and simply to be there", she said, "it's like nothing I've ever sensed before". The gentle waves of a quiet pool lapping at her toes, the soft glow of the last rays from the lightglobe on blades of grass stretching towards the horizon, the feeling of calm that she experienced while constructing objects and exploring creative use of the world's materials, all contributed to a 60% reduction in self-reported stress levels, a 75% reduction in noise-related tooth grinding, and a 35% increase in self-reported satisfaction with personal internet interactions.
</p>
<p>
"I feel so much more at ease after a little time enjoying the serenity inside the Zentronix," said Cathy P1519 on a recent vid-chat. "I couldn't live without it."
</p>
<p>~~Dan Z8907~~</p>
<p>
Dan Z8907 thinks of himself as just a normal guy, nothing special. He wakes up early in every cycle, performs his standard hygenie requirement, and settles in for a long day of productivity. He is a high-productivity individual, so his schedule permits time for breaks. And during these breaks, Dan Z8907 always turns to his Zentronix. "I just love the way it feels to switch on the Zentronix, and kind of switch off for a while. Don't get me wrong, I love my work, and I wouldn't trade it for any other work, but it's good every now and then to briefly enter a zone with no demands on my attention," says Dan Z8907.
</p>
<p>
And Dan Z8907's occasional visits to the Zentronix have been measured to increase his productivity in other zones of his life as well. His task conversion rate actually increases in the hours after a visit to the Zentronix. And his calmness indicators are greatly increased, with a long-tail falloff over the course of the cycle. Dan Z8907's monthly review metrics raised across the board in the months after ordering his new Zentronix, and he recommends it to others who aspire to his high-productivity lifestyle. "I think the Zentronix is an essential tool for maintaining my status as a high-productivity individual. It's great."
